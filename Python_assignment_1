## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?
Ans1: Because it is easy to understand to Humans.


Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?
Ans2: Because we do not need to specify types name every time.


Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?
Ans3: 
Pros-
1. Beginner-Friendly 
2. Large Community
3. Flexible and Extensible
4. Extensive Libraries 
5. Embeddable
6. Highly Scalable
7. IOT Opportunities
8. Machine Learning
9. Portable

Cons-
1. Issues with Design
2. Slower than Compiled Languages
3. Security
4. Work Environment
5. Pythonâ€™s Memory Consumption and Garbage Collection
6. Python is Dynamically Typed
7. Multithreading in Python 


Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?
Ans4: Yes we can use python almost all domain like game development, mobile app development, web development, 
machine learning, deep learning, artificial intelligence, data domain etc.


Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?
Ans5: Variable is like a container where value is stored. we can declare them by any supported format name.
example- a=10, name="asif", boolvar=False etc 


Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?
Ans6: by using input() function.


Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?
Ans7: String.


Q8. What is type casting?
Ans8: Change data type from one to another. like integer to float, float to integer, string to integer etc.


Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?
Ans9: If we use only input() then we can not take more than one input from user Because input() function is built with
 such functionality. But if we add split() function with input() function then we can take multiple inputs.
ex:
x, y = input("Enter two values: ").split()
print("Number of x: ", x)
print("Number of y: ", y)


Q10. What are keywords?
Ans10: Keywords are reserved or predefined words.


Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.
Ans11: No, we can not use keywords as a variable name. Because keywords itself is a valuable words that can not use as a variable. 
Variable has its own way to write.


Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?
Ans12: Indentation is a format in any programming language which is defined as a space. One space is refer one indentation. 
In Python itself has 4 space count as predefined indentation.


Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?
Ans13: We can use print() funciton to fine any output.


Q14. What are operators in Python?
Ans14: Operators are mathmetical functions. like +, -, *, /, ** etc. 


# Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?
Ans14: 


# Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
# ```
# iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
# ```
string_var = "iNeuron"
print(string_var * 4)
